    This crates a sampling mask that densely samples the center while

    When called, ``MaskFunc`` uses internal functions create mask by 1)
    creating a mask for the k-space center, 2) create a mask outside of the
    k-space center, and 3) combining them into a total mask. The internals are
    handled by ``sample_mask``, which calls ``calculate_center_mask`` for (1)
    and ``calculate_acceleration_mask`` for (2). The combination is executed
    in the ``MaskFunc`` ``__call__`` function.

    If you would like to implement a new mask, simply subclass ``MaskFunc``
    and overwrite the ``sample_mask`` logic. See examples in ``RandomMaskFunc``
