Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) by acquiring fewer measurements
has the potential to reduce medical costs, minimize stress to patients and make
MR imaging possible in applications where it is currently prohibitively slow or
expensive.

[fastMRI](https://fastMRI.org) is a collaborative research project from
Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and NYU Langone Health to investigate the use of AI
to make MRI scans faster. NYU Langone Health has released fully anonymized knee
and brain MRI datasets that can be downloaded from
[the fastMRI dataset page](https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/). Publications
associated with the fastMRI project can be found
[at the end of this README](#list-of-papers).

This repository contains convenient PyTorch data loaders, subsampling
functions, evaluation metrics, and reference implementations of simple baseline
methods. It also contains implementations for methods in some of the
publications of the fastMRI project.

## Documentation

### The fastMRI Dataset

There are multiple publications describing different subcomponents of the data
(e.g., brain vs. knee) and associated baselines.

* **Project Summary, Datasets, Baselines:** [fastMRI: An Open Dataset and Benchmarks for Accelerated MRI ({J. Zbontar*, F. Knoll*, A. Sriram*} et al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08839)

* **Knee Data:** [fastMRI: A Publicly Available Raw k-Space and DICOM Dataset of Knee Images for Accelerated MR Image Reconstruction Using Machine Learning ({F. Knoll*, J. Zbontar*} et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1148/ryai.2020190007)

* **Brain Dataset Properties:** [Supplemental Material](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/42/9526230/9420272/supp1-3075856.pdf?arnumber=9420272) of [Results of the 2020 fastMRI Challenge for Machine Learning MR Image Reconstruction ({M. Muckley*, B. Riemenschneider*} et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2021.3075856)

### Code Repository

For code documentation, most functions and classes have accompanying docstrings
that you can access via the `help` function in IPython. For example:

```python
from fastmri.data import SliceDataset

help(SliceDataset)
```

## Dependencies and Installation

**Note:** Contributions to the code are continuously tested via GitHub actions.
If you encounter an issue, the best first thing to do is to try to match the
`tests` environment in `setup.cfg`, e.g., `pip install --editable ".[tests]"`
when installing from source.

**Note:** As documented in [Issue 215](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI/issues/215),
there is currently a memory leak when using `h5py` installed from `pip` and
converting to a `torch.Tensor`. To avoid the leak, you need to use `h5py` with
a version of HDF5 before 1.12.1. As of February 16, 2022, the `conda` version
of `h5py` 3.6.0 used HDF5 1.10.6, which avoids the leak.

First install PyTorch according to the directions at the
[PyTorch Website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/) for your operating system
and CUDA setup. Then, run

```bash
pip install fastmri
```

`pip` will handle all package dependencies. After this you should be able to
run most of the code in the repository.

### Installing Directly from Source

If you want to install directly from the GitHub source, clone the repository,
navigate to the `fastmri` root directory and run

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Package Structure & Usage

The repository is centered around the `fastmri` module. The following breaks
down the basic structure:

`fastmri`: Contains a number of basic tools for complex number math, coil
combinations, etc.

* `fastmri.data`: Contains data utility functions from original `data` folder
that can be used to create sampling masks and submission files.
* `fastmri.models`: Contains reconstruction models, such as the U-Net and
VarNet.
* `fastmri.pl_modules`: PyTorch Lightning modules for data loading, training,
and logging.

## Examples and Reproducibility

The `fastmri_examples` and `banding_removal` folders include code for
reproducibility. The baseline models were used in the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08839).

A brief summary of implementions based on papers with links to code follows.
For completeness we also mention work on active acquisition, which is hosted
in another repository.

## Testing

Run `pytest tests`. By default integration tests that use the fastMRI data are
skipped. If you would like to run these tests, set `SKIP_INTEGRATIONS` to
`False` in the [conftest](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI/tree/master/tests/conftest.py).

## Training a model

The [data README](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI/tree/master/fastmri/data/README.md) has a bare-bones example for how to
load data and incorporate data transforms. This
[jupyter notebook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI/tree/master/fastMRI_tutorial.ipynb) contains a simple tutorial
explaining how to get started working with the data.

Please look at
[this U-Net demo script](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI/tree/master/fastmri_examples/unet/train_unet_demo.py) for an
example of how to train a model using the PyTorch Lightning framework.

## Submitting to the Leaderboard

Run your model on the provided test data and create a zip file containing your
predictions. `fastmri` has a `save_reconstructions` function that saves the
data in the correct format.

Upload the zip file to any publicly accessible cloud storage (e.g. Amazon S3,
Dropbox etc). Submit a link to the zip file on the
[challenge website](https://fastmri.org/submit). You will need to create an
account before submitting.
